**Today's Weather Web App**

This is a simple web application that allows users to check the weather conditions for a specific city. Users can enter the name of the city they want to know the weather for, and the application fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The weather information displayed includes temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:
- Dynamic weather data display
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Easy-to-use interface with a search functionality

This project serves as a beginner-friendly example for integrating APIs into web applications and manipulating DOM elements dynamically based on fetched data.
